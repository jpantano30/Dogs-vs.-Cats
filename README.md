# Dogs-vs.-Cats
A game of tic-tac-toe with a coin toss to decide who starts the game off.

UPDATE:
Currently, the 2 player version when player 1 loses the coin toss, is not working & the 4x4 board for 2 player is not working. Will come back to later.

 <ul> 
  <li> As a friend, I want to view Jena's ideas for this game come to life, so that I can know she is learning and achieving goals.</li>

<summary> Approach </summary>
 <ul> 
  <li>I started with the HTML structure, adding modals, buttons, and the game board.</li>
  <li>I then applied CSS styling. I created the game board grid structure.</li>
  <li>The game logic is implemented in JavaScript.</li>
  <li>I used event listeners for buttons, input, and making moves on the board. I collected player names and choices for one or two players, as well as the board size. I used HTML elements to create and update the game board dynamically. I created functionality to reset the coin toss, restart the game, and reset the entire page</li>
  <li>I implemented a coin toss, allowing players to choose heads or tails. The result is determined randomly, and the game state is updated accordingly.</li>
  <li>I defined winning combinations and implemented a function to check for a winner or a tie after each move.</li>
  <li>Scores for each player are tracked, and I implemented a function to update the scoreboard based on the game state. </li>
  <li>For one-player games, I created a function to simulate the computer making a move after the player's move. </li>
  <li>The user interface is updated dynamically based on the game state, with messages displayed for coin toss results, game outcomes, and tie situations.</li>
 </ul>

I made this game to practice my JavaScript skills and chose this game because I felt like it was something id be able to understand and added some of my own flair by using images of my dog and of a cat.
